# Course and Feedback System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Route Conflicts and Organization
**Problem**: Route conflicts between student feedback routes and general feedback routes
**Fix**: 
- Separated student feedback routes with proper naming (`student.feedback.*`)
- Removed conflicting route definitions
- Organized routes by user role (student, lecturer, admin)

### 2. Missing Controller Methods
**Problem**: Routes referenced methods that didn't exist
**Fix**:
- Added `showJoinForm()` method to `StudentCourseController`
- Ensured all route methods exist in their respective controllers

### 3. Database Field Inconsistencies
**Problem**: `CourseMaterial` model used `lecturer_id` but migration used `uploaded_by`
**Fix**:
- Updated `CourseMaterial` model to use `uploaded_by` field consistently
- Updated `CourseController` to use correct field name
- Fixed relationship definitions

### 4. Course Enrollment Logic
**Problem**: Incomplete course join functionality and missing validation
**Fix**:
- Added course join form route (`/student/courses/join`)
- Added enrollment slot validation (max 50 students per course)
- Improved re-enrollment logic for dropped students
- Added `hasAvailableSlots()` and `getCurrentEnrollmentCountAttribute()` methods to Course model

### 5. Feedback System Improvements
**Problem**: Missing validation and automation features
**Fix**:
- Added automatic feedback type detection in model boot method
- Added overdue feedback detection and escalation
- Created `EscalateOverdueFeedback` command for automation
- Added `isOverdue()` and `escalateIfOverdue()` methods to Feedback model

### 6. File Upload Validation
**Problem**: Limited file type validation for course materials
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive file type validation (pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, txt, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, mp4, avi, mov)
- Maintained 10MB file size limit

### 7. Course Enrollment Model Enhancements
**Problem**: Missing utility methods for enrollment management
**Fix**:
- Added `isActive()` method to check enrollment status
- Added `getEnrollmentDurationAttribute()` to track enrollment duration
- Improved status management

## New Features Added

### 1. Course Enrollment Management
- Course capacity limits (50 students max)
- Re-enrollment for dropped students
- Enrollment duration tracking
- Available slots checking

### 2. Feedback Automation
- Automatic priority escalation for overdue feedback
- Scheduled command for feedback management
- Overdue detection (7+ days)

### 3. Enhanced Validation
- File type restrictions for course materials
- Course enrollment validation
- Feedback type auto-detection

## Route Structure

### Student Routes
- `/student/feedback` - Student feedback management
- `/student/courses` - Course enrollment and viewing
- `/student/courses/join` - Course join form

### Lecturer Routes
- `/lecturer/feedback` - Lecturer feedback management
- `/lecturer/courses` - Course management

### Admin Routes
- `/admin/feedback` - Admin feedback management

## Database Consistency

All models now use consistent field names:
- `CourseMaterial.uploaded_by` (instead of `lecturer_id`)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Consistent status enums

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Clear caches**: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear`
2. **Check routes**: `php artisan route:list --name=feedback`
3. **Test course enrollment**: Try joining courses as a student
4. **Test feedback**: Submit and respond to feedback
5. **Test file uploads**: Upload course materials with various file types

## Commands Available

- `php artisan feedback:escalate-overdue` - Escalate overdue feedback priority

## Security Improvements

- Proper role-based access control
- File type validation
- Enrollment validation
- Feedback ownership verification

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while improving system reliability and user experience.
