# Course Security Verification - Lecturer Access Control

## Current Security Implementation ✅

The system already has proper security measures in place to ensure lecturers can only see and edit courses they created themselves.

### 1. Course Listing (CourseController::index)
```php
$courses = Course::where('lecturer_id', Auth::id())
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->get();
```
**Security**: ✅ Only shows courses where `lecturer_id` matches the logged-in user's ID.

### 2. Course View (CourseController::show)
```php
if ($course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()) {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access to this course.');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Prevents access to courses not owned by the lecturer.

### 3. Course Edit (CourseController::edit)
```php
if ($course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()) {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access to this course.');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Prevents editing of courses not owned by the lecturer.

### 4. Course Update (CourseController::update)
```php
if ($course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()) {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access to this course.');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Prevents updating of courses not owned by the lecturer.

### 5. Course Delete (CourseController::destroy)
```php
if ($course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()) {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access to this course.');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Prevents deletion of courses not owned by the lecturer.

### 6. Course Material Management
```php
if ($course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()) {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access to this course.');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Prevents uploading materials to courses not owned by the lecturer.

### 7. Assessment Management (AssessmentController)
```php
$courses = Course::where('lecturer_id', Auth::id())->get();
```
**Security**: ✅ Only shows lecturer's own courses when creating assessments.

## View-Level Security

### Lecturer Courses View (`lecturer/courses.blade.php`)
- **Title**: "My Courses" - clearly indicates ownership
- **Description**: "Here you can view and manage all your created courses"
- **Data Source**: Uses `$courses` from controller (already filtered by lecturer_id)
- **Security**: ✅ Only displays courses belonging to the logged-in lecturer

## Database-Level Security

### Course Model Relationships
```php
// Course belongs to Lecturer
public function lecturer(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'lecturer_id');
}

// User (Lecturer) has many Courses
public function taughtCourses(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(Course::class, 'lecturer_id');
}
```
**Security**: ✅ Proper relationships ensure data integrity.

## Route-Level Security

### Lecturer Routes
All lecturer course routes are protected by middleware:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'track.activity'])->group(function () {
    // Lecturer routes
    Route::get('/lecturer/courses', [CourseController::class, 'index'])->name('lecturer.courses.index');
    Route::get('/lecturer/courses/create', [CourseController::class, 'create'])->name('lecturer.courses.create');
    Route::post('/lecturer/courses', [CourseController::class, 'store'])->name('lecturer.courses.store');
    Route::get('/lecturer/courses/{course}/edit', [CourseController::class, 'edit'])->name('lecturer.courses.edit');
    Route::put('/lecturer/courses/{course}', [CourseController::class, 'update'])->name('lecturer.courses.update');
    Route::delete('/lecturer/courses/{course}', [CourseController::class, 'destroy'])->name('lecturer.courses.destroy');
    Route::get('/lecturer/courses/{course}', [CourseController::class, 'show'])->name('lecturer.courses.show');
});
```
**Security**: ✅ All routes require authentication and have controller-level authorization.

## Security Verification Tests

### Test 1: Lecturer A cannot see Lecturer B's courses
- ✅ CourseController::index filters by `lecturer_id = Auth::id()`
- ✅ Only courses created by the logged-in lecturer are returned

### Test 2: Lecturer A cannot access Lecturer B's course details
- ✅ CourseController::show checks `$course->lecturer_id !== Auth::id()`
- ✅ Returns 403 Unauthorized if lecturer doesn't own the course

### Test 3: Lecturer A cannot edit Lecturer B's course
- ✅ CourseController::edit checks ownership before allowing access
- ✅ CourseController::update validates ownership before allowing changes

### Test 4: Lecturer A cannot delete Lecturer B's course
- ✅ CourseController::destroy checks ownership before allowing deletion

### Test 5: Lecturer A cannot upload materials to Lecturer B's course
- ✅ CourseController::uploadMaterial checks course ownership

## Additional Security Features

### 1. Course Creation
```php
$courseData['lecturer_id'] = Auth::id();
```
**Security**: ✅ Automatically assigns the creating lecturer as the owner.

### 2. Course Code Generation
```php
$courseData['course_code'] = Course::generateCourseCode();
```
**Security**: ✅ Unique course codes prevent conflicts.

### 3. Soft Delete
```php
$course->update(['is_active' => false]);
```
**Security**: ✅ Courses are deactivated rather than deleted, preserving data integrity.

## Recommendations for Enhanced Security

### 1. Add Logging
Consider adding audit logs for course access and modifications:
```php
Log::info('Course accessed', [
    'user_id' => Auth::id(),
    'course_id' => $course->id,
    'action' => 'view'
]);
```

### 2. Add Rate Limiting
Consider adding rate limiting for course operations:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function () {
    // Course routes
});
```

### 3. Add CSRF Protection
Already implemented via Laravel's built-in CSRF protection.

## Conclusion

✅ **The course security implementation is comprehensive and secure.**

- **Data Isolation**: Lecturers can only see their own courses
- **Access Control**: All CRUD operations check ownership
- **View Security**: UI clearly indicates ownership
- **Route Protection**: All routes require authentication
- **Database Integrity**: Proper relationships and constraints

The system successfully prevents lecturers from seeing or editing courses created by other lecturers, ensuring complete data isolation and security.
